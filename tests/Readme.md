The command:

```bash
python -c "from app.agent import root_agent; print(root_agent.name)"
```

is essentially a **smoke test** or a **sanity check**.

---

### What kind of test is it?

* **Smoke Test:** It verifies that the basic setup and imports work without errors. It checks if the `root_agent` can be imported and that its `.name` property is accessible and prints correctly.
* **Sanity Check:** It confirms that the code environment is properly configured and the core object (`root_agent`) exists and is correctly instantiated.


---

### Summary:

* Quick, lightweight test for basic verification.
* Useful for ensuring environment setup, imports, and object instantiation are correct before running more detailed tests.
